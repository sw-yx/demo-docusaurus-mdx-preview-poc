import * as WhatIsWorker from './what-is-worker.mdx'

Here is some mumbo jumbo. If you ever wondered about <preview page={WhatIsWorker}>what is a worker?</preview> then you have come to the right place.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
